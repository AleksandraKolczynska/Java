Challenge 340 - Write a program that outputs the first recurring character in a string. 

Challenge 378 - 1. Remove all 0's from the sequence.
2. If the sequence is now empty (no elements left), stop and return true.
3. Sort the sequence in descending order.
4. Remove the first answer (which is also the largest answer, or tied for the largest) from the sequence and call it N. 
5. If N is greater than the length of this new sequence, stop and return false.
6. Subtract 1 from each of the first N elements of the new sequence.

Challenge 377 - You have a 2-dimensional rectangular crate of size X by Y, and a bunch of boxes, each of size x by y. 
The dimensions are all positive integers. For instance, if the crate is size X = 25 by Y = 18, and the boxes are size x = 6 by y = 5,
then the answer is 12. You can fit 4 boxes along the x-axis (because 6*4 <= 25), and 3 boxes along the y-axis (because 5*3 <= 18), 
so in total you can fit 4*3 = 12 boxes in a rectangle.

Challenge 374 - Calculate the additive persistence of a number.

Challenge 372 - Given a string containing only the characters x and y, find whether there are the same number of xs and ys.
